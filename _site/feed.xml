        <title>Vergine - Al Gal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had been waiting for a while for the weather to be good enough for us to get up into the mountains. It had snowed two days earlier but this route is east facing so we thought it would probably be OK now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/verginealgal/IMG_20150906_233555.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;topo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the cable car up to the albigna dam, well worth the CHF18! The views over the dam and the mountains were amazing, and on the walk up we saw an ermine, very very cute and inquisitive, clearly checking us out before scampering away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/verginealgal/effect-express1441650381174.png&quot; alt=&quot;albigna lake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our German guidebook indicates that it should take 50 minutes from the cable car but it took us about 1 hour 20 mins, I think we are pretty slow walkers. When we arrived at the base of the climb we were looking for the start (obviously), the route begins right on the corner, not part of the way in from the left side as the topo suggests. I’m having doubts about this very expensive guidebook. Anyway there’s an red arrow painted on a rock showing the start of the route. There were also a few, very sparse bolts, reassuring as we knew we were on route.&lt;br /&gt;
We alternated leads which was more fun for me and a bit less stressful for the boy who usually leads most things, especially in the mountains. It was really good climbing, very enjoyable, but I got really cold at the summit and shivered about getting my big jacket on and eating a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/verginealgal/effect-express1441649710823.png&quot; alt=&quot;summit pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We abbed down and hurried back into the sunlight. Just after we had got back to the stuff we left at the bottom the party above us dislodged a terrifyingly big rock right where we had been just 5 minutes earlier. Helmets would not have offered any protection :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/verginealgal/IMG_20150907_135823.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;abb tat&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the sun!&lt;br /&gt;

        <title>The door is fixed!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had bumped into this German couple at a few crags and then at a cafe where we got chatting. After a pizza and a few coffees we spoke about our rucksack bouldering mat and the fact that our back door was broken. Turns out Wolfgang is a bit of a mechanical whizz and after about half an hour he had the door open, as well as showing us what to do if it happens again. Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/doorisfixed/IMG_20150905_182952.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/doorisfixed/IMG_20150905_185153.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fixed 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically prepare for lots of smug van photos with both back doors open.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gallivaggio and Camping Aquafraggia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided that to improve our ropework some multipitch sport routes would be ideal, and as it turns out the ones at Gallavaggio were really good.  We were impressed with our speedy selves and managed to get to the top much faster than we thought we could, the training is working! Multi pitch sport is pretty fun, none of the stress of trad or the slog of mountains, but admittedly the views are not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gallavaggio/IMG_20150905_224739.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;topo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gallavaggio/effect-express1441649945117.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;top out&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we scrambled up the river, relaxed and read our books. And had a swim, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gallavaggio/effect-express1441649839804.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;waterfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also visited the aquafraggia campsite and the guy who runs it has drawn loads of lovely topos in a huge book that is out for people to look at. He’s also put versions of them all up &lt;a href=&quot;http://campingacquafraggia.com/climbindex_en.htm&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; for free. The topo above is one of these.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Waiting for a weather window</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We want to climb a few things up in the mountains so we need to wait for good conditions. There’s also loads to climb down in the valley, when it’s not raining. Luckily its still pretty here even when the weather is dismal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/weatherwindow/IMG_20150902_103742.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;clouds and mountains&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only rained for a couple of days but there had been snow in the mountains and the odd bit of overnight rain meant that conditions weren’t ideal. We spent some time sport climbing at sasso del drago over in italy (where its is SO much cheaper to buy food). This place is great for a quick climb, roadside and dries quickly so when other crags were still suffering with seepage this one was dry. Good range of climbs from 4a to 8a. There are great topos on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://campingacquafraggia.com/climbindex_en.htm&quot;&gt;aquafraggia website&lt;/a&gt; for this crag and loads of other routes in the area as well as some of the mountains. We had a great days bouldering too, slightly precarious though as I broke the back door of the van the day we left, which meant that our ingenious bouldering mat slot now traps the bouldering mat inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/weatherwindow/IMG_20150717_140856.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;van in progress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part way through our build when the bouldering mat slot, on the left, was a great idea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we had to use our rucksacks, a disappointing solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/weatherwindow/effect-express1441736509954.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;boulder park&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/weatherwindow/IMG_20150901_120001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rucksacks as bouldering mats&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/weatherwindow/IMG_20150901_115607.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bouldering&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also been doing some training to get up more prepared for the mountains, timing ourselves taking coils and going on uphill walks to pretty waterfalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/weatherwindow/20150904_102821.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;waterfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Swiss Lakes 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was SO lovely! We bought a hideously expensive guidebook, Graubunden, which is in german :/ but has great topos and covers a huge area. We chilled out by lake chazza and when we got too hot decided to swim to the little island just off the shore. We tested out the waterproofness of the camera with a full submerge and have decided that it’s trustworthy :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt2/P1090875.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;hammock&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt2/P1090885.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt2/P1090886.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;swim&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went for a climb just over the road (and up a steep path!) at plaun da lej. As we were sorting our gear out we decided that this was not the best carabiner for belaying…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt2/20150831_205753.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;jiveassbelays&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climbing was great and the views from the top over the lake and mountains were amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt2/P1090890.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;climbing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt2/P1090893.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;climbing2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy cooked tea and i got to relax and watch the sunset over the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Swiss Lakes 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided to leave the dolomites as we weren’t enjoying the rock type and were keen to climb some mountains before it’s too late in the year. We drove to Switzerland and stopped off near our destination of Val Bregaglia in Sankt Moritz. It’s very posh! We walked round the lake and had a welcome swim after the long drive before finding a great place to park up further down the road. There are 3 lakes high up in the alps and we spent the night right on the shore. Waking up to these amazing views is may favourite thing about the van.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt1/20150830_095930.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lakemorning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent the day relaxing, reading and swimming by the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt1/20150830_155314.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt1/P1090870.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;lake2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt1/20150830_155513.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;selfie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on we went on to the next lake, lake silvaplana to watch the windsurfers. It was crazily windy, i guess that was why it was so busy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/swisslakespt1/20150830_165941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;kitesurfers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another lovely spot where we cooked tea with another great view!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Marmot Cam</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We had first heard, and then seen this marmot (or one of a group of marmots) at an entrance to a cave where some of the climbs are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/marmotcam/IMG_20150828_115054.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;marmotcave&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hadn’t managed to get a photo of it and the boy has this fancy camera that has a remote setting we can link to my tablet, and the idea was to set the camera up on a tripod close to the cave entrance and then retreat to an unthreatening distance. We saw the marmot on the way down to the climbs so thought it would be a good time to set up the camera. We tried not to spook the marmot but it disappeared inside the cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/marmotcam/20150828_103546.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sneaky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat around the corner from the camera waiting to see if it wold come out, but about 10 minutes later realised that the camera was being coveted by a group of pre-pubescent boys who were creeping up on it thinking no-one was around. They also clambered all over marmot rock which probably spooked it. We set up the camera again near us at another entrance we had seen the marmot at, and set the camera to take a photo every minute or so. With the camera just in sight we climbed for around an hour and then checked the photos. Nothing. We assumed the marmot had just left because we and the kids were too noisy so gave up, but when we walked around the back he was bloody looking at us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/marmotcam/IMG_20150828_114904.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;marmot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily the next day i managed to get a couple of blurry snaps!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rossi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although we still were not sure about the dolomite rock we thought we should at least give one of the many multi-pitch routes in the dolomites a go. We settled on Rossi as it was well within our abilities grade wise but slightly more pitches than we’ve done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rossi/IMG_20150827_075458.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rossi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We parked up close to the climb, one of the better things about the dolomites over val masino was the proximity of the climbs, no slogging for us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rossi/effect-express1440272183740.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;vanview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to move together for a few pitches like we had done so successfully on the sfinge. However there was nowhere to place gear so we faffed around and dropped our coils and basically wasted a bunch of time. We were caught up by an Italian guide and two kids (his? who knows?) and they clumsily overtook us. I have held no problem with being overtaken at ab points but the irritating thing here was that the guide was fast but the two kids behind him were slow which meant that we kept crossing paths, there was a tremendous amount of rope faff and the boy got held up at the crux because the youngest kid couldn’t do it. Ugh. Anyway we had a sandwich break and let them get on with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rossi/IMG_20150822_115600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;couplesclimb&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rossi/IMG_20150823_120909.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rope&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top was interesting as the ab ring was not immediately obvious and after the boy built a belay and I climbed up, the walk around the chamois terrace (sadly devoid of chamois) looked pretty sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rossi/IMG_20150822_134948.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chamoisterrace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However when we got round to the places with huge drops they had chains to sling yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/rossi/IMG_20150822_140111.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chainedin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shared abseils down with some friendly guys and went back to enjoy a coffee and the view from the back door of the van :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Citta dei Sassi</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The city of stones. We arrived in the rain and clouds and the next morning woke up to an amazing view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cittidelsassi/20150828_121114.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cittadeisassi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is loads of sport climbing pretty close to where we parked but not road-side so it feels more remote, especially with the dramatic setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cittidelsassi/IMG_20150828_114804.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rocks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our rockfax guide book is great for getting us to the area but I’m not convinced that it’s massively accurate. Luckily most of the climbs are labeled :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a couple of days ticking off climbs and prepping to climb something a little higher. Not convinced that I like dolomite rock, i miss val masino and it’s grippy grippy granite.&lt;/p&gt;
