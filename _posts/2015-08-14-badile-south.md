## Approach

<p>From Bagni Masino follow signs to Gianetti hut. From the the Gianetti hut traces of a path (ciarns) meander over small firm rocks and moraine in a northerly direction up to the buttress foot of the ridge.</p>

<h2 id="route">Route</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Keep L(W) of the moraine and rocks extending down from the ridge and cross snow patches at the right side of the small glacier in the bay below the col del badile.</li>
  <li>rise a short distance above the level of the ridge foot proper and turn in close to it, finding a gangway slanting from left to right across the west side of the buttress.</li>
  <li>Ascend gangway to crest and pass onto east side.</li>
  <li>scramble along easy ledges overhung by jutting rocks, leftwards up into a steep chimney (III) which leads into the crest.</li>
  <li>follow a system of narrow ledges below crest on the east side again, into a broad open couloir that merges higher up into the face of the mountain climbing in the trough ahead, almost anywhere.</li>
  <li>finnish by one of two little parellel gullies on the summit ridge, about 40m west of the cairn.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="descent">Descent</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Go down the gully trough and take the ledge system on E side of the ridge.</li>
  <li>Just before reaching the percipitous step of the terminal buttress turn sharp right (W) and pass over a little spur to find the gang way slanting down the west side of the buttress to snow at its foot.</li>
  <li>The penalty for missing this turning is two long and uncomfortble abseils down a gritty ice gulley.</li>
</ol>

## Comments

A good forcast lured us up into the mountains, but despite the heat in the valley clouds waited to greet us at the hut. We and about 25 extra people took refuge on the bar floor while it rained in the night. We were awoken by the guardians at 5:30 who were keen to reassemble the furniture for breakfast. We ate ours then trudged towards the south ridge which was easy to spot from the hut. Once reaching the buttress we walked up for a short distance but couldn't see the ramp so considered climbing a promising looking crack, but once at the base of the crack the ramp revealed itself so we quickly got back on route.

Progress from here was simple though we chose to rope up to save one of us carrying all the rope but this slowed us down significantly. The grade III chimney had a horrible thrutchy start, there is a fixed rope to help but it looked absolutly knackered so I ignored it. Reaching the cross at the top climb a little chimney/gulley thing behind then head right to ledges/paths. we missed the turning and ended up on the ridge which was abit pants.

After spotting some fixed rope below us we downclimbed from the crest to the origional route, again the fixed rope looked like a liability so I climbed a chossy unprotected section up towars an ab station. Once we were both there we discussed options. We were well behind schedule and not really enjoying the route. Concerns about the amount of time it would take to get back lead us to head back from there.

This turned out to be an unfounded worry as we made on abseil back to the ledges, then packed up the rope and quickly walked most of the way back. two final abseils from the cross lead us to the base of the route and we discovered a lost lion bar mid abseil which made the retreat much more rewarding.
