We decided that to improve our ropework some multipitch sport routes would be ideal, and as it turns out the ones at Gallavaggio were really good.  We were impressed with our speedy selves and managed to get to the top much faster than we thought we could, the training is working! Multi pitch sport is pretty fun, none of the stress of trad or the slog of mountains, but admittedly the views are not *quite* as good.

After lunch we scrambled up the river, relaxed and read our books. And had a swim, obviously.

We also visited the aquafraggia campsite and the guy who runs it has drawn loads of lovely topos in a huge book that is out for people to look at. He's also put versions of them all up [online](/www.campingaquafraggia.com) for free. The topo above is one of these.
