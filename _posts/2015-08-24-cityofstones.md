The city of stones. We arrived in the rain and clouds and the next morning woke up to an amazing view.

There is loads of sport climbing pretty close to twhere we parked but not road-side so it feels more remote, especially with the dramatic setting.

Our rockfax guide book is great for getting us to the area but I'm not convinced that it's massively accurate. Luckily most of the climbs are labelled :)

We spent a couple of days ticking off climbs and prepping to climb something a little higher. Not convinced that I like dolomite rock, i miss val masino and it's grippy grippy granite.
