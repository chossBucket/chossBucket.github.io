We thought we would go for a walk on the other side of the valley to get some nice views over the mont blanc range. We were able to park fairly high up but it was still a big hike up to the top. It had snowed a couple of days before meaning there was snow on our side of the valley, at the very top and the views from the summit, and on the way up, were well worth the walk.

We got a great view of the drus from up here, a climb that is on the boys wish list. Bit scary for me!
