title: A cheapskates guide to Val Masino
---

We stopped near San Martino. Water fountains are everywhere, free parking is to be found between most of the little villages though no one seems to check the tickets on the other car parks any way. There are public toilets by the main sport climbing area. There is a reasonable internet connection at Bar Monica and they have guide books you can read while you have a drink. Also a small shop for food but it is quite pricey so stock up on non-perishables elsewhere.

It is not possible to buy a guide book in english at the local climbing shop so I'd bring one with you.

Some topos!
