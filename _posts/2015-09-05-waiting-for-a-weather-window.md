We want to climb a few things up in the mountains so we need to wait for good conditions. There's also loads to climb down in the valley, when it's not raining. Luckily its still pretty here even when the weather is dismal.

It only rained for a couple of days but there had been snow in the mountains and the odd bit of overnight rain meant that conditions weren't ideal. We spent some time sport climbing at sasso del drago over in italy (where its is SO much cheaper to buy food). This place is great for a quick climb, roadside and dries quickly so when other crags were still suffering with seepage this one was dry. Good range of climbs from 4a to 8a. There are great topos on the [aquafraggia website](/www.campingaquafraggia.com) for this crag and loads of other routes in the area as well as some of the mountains. We had a great days bouldering too, slightly precarious though as I broke the back door of the van the day we left, which meant that our ingenious bouldering mat slot now traps the bouldering mat inside.

This is part way through our build when the bouldering mat slot, on the left, was a great idea!

So we had to use our rucksacks, a disappointing solution.

We've also been doing some training to get up more prepared for the mountains, timing ourselves taking coils and going on uphill walks to pretty waterfalls.
