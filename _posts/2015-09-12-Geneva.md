So we did something unusual. We went sightseeing in Geneva, and we slept in an apartment, in an actual bed! It was great. My uncle works in an international school in Geneva, he put us up for the weekend and showed us the sights!
We went for cheese fondue on the lake, totally amazing, if incredibly rich.

We went to see neil hannon of the divine comedy play which was really nice, haven't seen any live music since we've been out here.

The next day we went to the museum of ethnography, we only went to the free bit but it kept us entertained whilst my uncle planned next weeks lessons. There were some great examples of old musical instruments, clothing from around the world, as well as a 25 meter screen playing rolling crashing waves. It didn't seem to fit in with anything around it but it was nice to look at!

We tried to go to cern but it turns out that the visitor center is closed until may next year so we headed over to the united nations building and then the botanical gardens before getting the boat taxi back for a curry.
