We decided to leave the dolomites as we weren't enjoying the rock type and were keen to climb some mountains before it's too late in the year. We drove to Switzerland and stopped off near our destination of Val Bregaglia in Sankt Moritz. It's very posh! We walked round the lake and had a welcome swim after the long drive before finding a great place to park up further down the road. There are 3 lakes high up in the alps and we spent the night right on the shore. Waking up to these amazing views is may favourite thing about the van.

We spent the day relaxing, reading and swimming by the lake.

Later on we went on to the next lake, lake silvaplana to watch the windsurfers. It was crazily windy, i guess that was why it was so busy!

We had another lovely spot where we cooked tea with another great view!
