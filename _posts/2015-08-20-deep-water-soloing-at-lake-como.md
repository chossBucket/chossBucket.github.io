We had gone through Naomis wild swimming book and had seen that one of the places had a "difficult" approach because to get to it you had to climb a short via ferratta. As we selfishly like swimming spots to ourselves and are reasonable climbers we headed over there. Not only was it a lovely quiet spot for swimming there were also sport routes on the edge of the lake and lots of places we could deep water solo.

We found a great place to park by the lake with mystery wifi, we had no idea where it was coming from!

We went back the next day to do some roped climbing and decided to test out the waterproofness of the waterproof camera we found last year in the alps. We got a bit scared of putting it in the water though, which resulted in a near-drowning experience...

But it's not broken! Maybe we will go for full submerge next time.
