Today was SO lovely! We bought a hideously expensive guidebook, Graubunden, which is in german :/ but has great topos and covers a huge area. We chilled out by lake chazza and when we got too hot decided to swim to the little island just off the shore. We tested out the waterproofness of the camera with a full submerge and have decided that it's trustworthy :)

We went for a climb just over the road (and up a steep path!) at plaun da lej. As we were sorting our gear out we decided that this was not the best carabiner for belaying...

The climbing was great and the views from the top over the lake and mountains were amazing.

The boy cooked tea and i got to relax and watch the sunset over the lake.
